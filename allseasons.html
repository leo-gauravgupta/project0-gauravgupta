      <p>
        A <span class="boldunder">season</span> is a division of the year marked by changes in weather, ecology, and amount of daylight.
        <div id="content"> <!-- CSS #id selector  -->
        Generally, there are <span class="boldunder">four calendar-based seasons</span> recognized:
        <ol>
          <li>Winter</li>
          <li>Spring</li>
          <li>Summer</li>
          <li>Autumn or Fall</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        To know more about the calendar-based seasons (for Nothern Hemisphere), please refer to the table below and given links:
      </p>
      <div class="panel panel-default"> <!--Bootstrap sourced table starts-->
      <table class="table">
    <tr>
      <th>Season</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
      <th>Link</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="winter_image.jpg" height = 20px align="left">Winter</td>
      <td>December to February</td>
      <td><a href="winter.html">Winter</a></td>

      <td>March to May</td>
      <td><a href="spring.html">Spring</a></td>

<p>
The Ecologists often use a <span class="boldunder">six-season model for temperate climate regions</span>, which eventually ties with the calendar-based seasons but these cover more specific changes in climate:
  <ul>
    <li>Prevernal <span class="italics">(early or pre-spring)</span></li>
    <li>Vernal <span class="italics">(spring)</span></li>
    <li>Estival <span class="italics">(high summer)</span></li>
    <li>Serotinal <span class="italics">(late summer)</span></li>
    <li>Autumnal <span class="italics">(autumn or fall)</span></li>
    <li>Hibernal <span class="italics">(winter)</span></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere:
</p>
<div class="container"> <!--Bootstrap's Grid Model -->
    <div><span class="boldunder">Prevernal</span> (early or pre-spring): Begins February (mild temperate), to March (cool temperate). Deciduous tree buds begin to swell. Some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats.</div>
    <div><span class="boldunder">Vernal</span> (spring): Begins mid March (mild temperate), to late April (cool temperate). Tree buds burst into leaves. Birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting.</div>
    <div><span class="boldunder">Estival</span> (high summer): Begins June in most temperate climates. Trees in full leaf. Birds hatch and raise offspring.</div>
    <div><span class="boldunder">Serotinal</span> (late summer): Generally begins mid to late August. Deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations (above 45 north). Young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration. The traditional "harvest season" begins by early September.</div>
    <div><span class="boldunder">Autumnal</span> (autumn): Generally begins mid to late September. Tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground. Birds migrate back to wintering areas.</div>
    <div><span class="boldunder">Hibernal</span> (winter): Begins December (mild temperate), November (cool temperate). Deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay. Migrating birds settled in winter habitats.</div>
